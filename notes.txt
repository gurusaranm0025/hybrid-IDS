DONE: TODO: identify target classes (how many tagrget classes are there?, one, two, three or four)

POSSIBLE TARGET CLASSES:    label_2: CDX<NPBO<TUN, - (legitamate traffic or a network buffer overflow attacks)
                            label_3: TUN<NPBO, - (legitimate traffic/direct attacks/obfuscated attacks)
                            label_poly: CDX<NPBO<TUN, - (ThreeOrTwoClassLabel_NetworkServiceAcronym)
                            label_poly_s: TUN, - (Three Class Label_Nerwork Service Name_Set of Network Modification Technique)
                            label_poly_o: NPBO - (Three Class Label_Obfuscation Technique Used_Network Service Acronymn)

TARGET CLASSES:
    ASNM-CDX-2009 - label_2
    ASNM-TUN - label_3 (with direct and obfuscated attacks under one same class)
    ASNM-NPBOv2 - label_3 (with direct and obfuscated attacks under one same class)

DATA ANALYSIS:
// waiting for target class identification
// still thinking

DATA PREPROCESSING: [depends on the models we are choosing]
// waiting for target class identification

FEATURE ENGINEERING:
1. do Forward feature selection - for feature selection

    ASNM-CDX-2009:
        1. label_2 - target class and performed normal FFS for model training.
    
    ASNM-TUN and ASNM-NPBO:
        3. MAYBE DROP the other label class columns.
        1. They did FFS DL and FFS DOL selections for two binary classification respectively.
        2. label_3 has three classes - legitamate traffic/direct attacks/obfuscated attacks - in this direct and obfuscated attacks are combined into one class.

MODELS:

AE Detector - LID (Local Intrinsic Dimensionality)

Traditional ML Model
Deep Learning Model
??? still thinking

ARCHITECTURE:

input -> feature extractor -> DL Model -> AE Extractor ---yes--> ML based Model --> Final result
                                |           |                                               ^
                                |           |                                               |
                                -------------------------------------------------------------

EVALUATION:
/// Not now, NOT YET....




//////////////// CURRENT WORK NOTES

1. implement\ a data preprocessor class with the strategy pattern - half way done.
2. put the data column removing step from data splitter into data injector class
